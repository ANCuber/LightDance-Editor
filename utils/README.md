## Assets

Assets used in editor are defined in [files/data/load.json](../files/data/load.json).

Once configured, you can generate empty data for database and upload.

```sh
# LightDance-Editor/utils
node generateInitialExport.js ../files/data/load.json ../files > jsons/exportDataEmpty.json
```

Everytime you modified assets, remember to update [files/data/load_hash.json](../files/data/load_hash.json) for auto-update in blender.

```sh
# LightDance-Editor/utils
node updateFileHash.js ../files > ../files/data/load_hash.json
```

### Model

Models should be exported from Blender in GLB format without animation data and materials, and placed in [files/asset/models/](../files/asset/models/).

### Music and Waveform

We use [audiowaveform](https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform/tree/master?fbclid=IwAR19jDCDp5DCzdLK7Z8EgE7W5NSjm8B-wdFABsrT62D2b80bVtCuydkMgnM) to generate waveform. Refer to [Installation](https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform/blob/master/README.md#installation) section to install the package first.

You need to update waveform [files/data/waveform.json](../files/data/waveform.json) when the music is modified.

```sh
# LightDance-Editor/utils
pnpm waveform
```

## Light Table Backup

### Save and Upload

You can save or upload light table to the database with [utils/saveData.js](../utils/saveData.js) and [utils/initDB.js](../utils/initDB.js).

```sh
# LightDance-Editor/utils
# Save to ./out/exportData.json
pnpm save
# Upload ./out/exportData.json to the database
pnpm initDB
```

### Auto-backup

The backups are stored in [LightTableBackup](https://github.com/NTUEELightDance/LightTableBackup).

To periodically create backup for database, you can use [scripts/backup/backup.sh](../scripts/backup/backup.sh).

```sh
# LightDance-Editor/scripts/backup
# Modify the path of repositories used in this script for your setup.
bash backup.sh
```
